##### ERROR LOGS #####

When a room has a fake user host, everything breaks.
the currently listening takes the host

UPDATING ROOM WHEN NOT HOST CREATES ONE LOL
AM I IN TWO ROOMS?
No, I basically create a new one and change the settings in that one

>>>>This broke queue.

Added two songs from spotconnect app (users queue)
then, skipped.
Had two users on room
Did all the actions above with the host one.
Queue only had the two songs, 1 on playing now, the otherone (2) on User's queue

>>>>This broke sync.
First incorrect song starts playing on guest user.
Tried sync, didnt work
For some reason sync desapeared.
When I f5 it was no longer there
Leaving room and joining fixed things

>> Added a song to users list and spot queue was empty after, what?


>> sometimes reaching the end of the song doesnt make it skip to next #THIS WILL BE HEAVY

>>> Failed to load users queueu might make that it never gets current song
get queue returns 500 server error
again, index out of range	
I think this queue bug occurs when I play a single song that doesnt load a queue
That will prevent the app to properly function

>>> There seems to be a problem with authentication. Gotta re check that.
I had to delete a user and re register for me to make it work
Deleting the spotify token from database also works and its faster
It might be that tokens are not being refreshed, or maybe ive beet putting singles all along
Gotta check that

>>>> Sync button not appearing?
For some reason, it doesnt load the sync button. Gotta check the values of guards.
I reloaded and it worked now... I also played something on spotify on a guest device
I may be wrong but I get the feeling these buttons work properly (after f5) when a song is playing

>>> Queue deleted itself for no reason 


>>> Manageing queue only works once the first song has finished and we use the backend queue



>>> Sometimes I will see spot queue (backend) on host but not on guest, why? check how queue is got
Maybe I need to make it so that it looks on the backend.
Well, I just saw I was in another room. So I was a host and that was ok. Why did I change rooms tho, maybe I left and created and forgot


>> The isHost might be broken because maybe you create a room then leave then you join one and the isHost variable doesnt update 
In fact, it works the opossite way aswell
Being in a room thats not yours, leaving and creating has isHost as false till reset.

I need to re-adjust isHost everytime i do stuff like
 > Leave room, join room

>>> I was host but isHost was false or something because sync button was there. Also, in this tab, I never was guest, so the former theory would not work here


NOTES:
	Dont forget to start redis when using windows.

	To return a queryset, which is not Json serializable, you can use
	First, data = list(queryset) to convert it to a list and then use
	JsonResponse to send it.

>> isHost not updating after creating room...


Pass json on get
